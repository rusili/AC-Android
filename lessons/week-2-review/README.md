# Lecture

In preparation for your assessment today, we will spend an hour doing practice
problems, and then take the exam.

## Review String functions

> **Exercise** Write three examples for creating a String object. Use the empty
string constructor, the constructor that accepts a char array and a constant
assignment.

> **Exercise** Refer to the Strings Api for this question. What method is used
in strings to find the first occurrence of a character? What method is used to
find the last occurrence?

> **Exercise** Write a function that counts the number of vowels in a string, up
to the first letter 'z'. For example 'aeizou' should return 3. Use a for loop.

## Writing a While Loop
> **Exercise** Write a function that counts the number of vowels in a string, up
to the first letter 'z'. For example 'aeizou' should return 3. Use a while loop.

> **Exercise** Write a while loop that prints out "{A Number} bottles" 100
times, once per line. '{A Number}' should be replaced with the numbers 0 to 99,
counting upwards.

> **Exercise** Write a while loop that prints out "{A Number} bottles" 100
times, once per line. '{A Number}' should be replaced with the numbers 99 to 0,
counting downwards.

## Comparing values in Arrays
> **Exercise** Write a for loop that iterates through an array of integers, and
prints out true each time a number is found that is less than 20.

> **Exercise** Write a while loop that iterates through an array of integers
until it sees the integer -40. For each integer, if the number is greater than
40, the loop should print out "Big Number"

> **Exercise** Write a block of code with a for loop that iterates through an array of integers, and at the end prints out the number of times the number 20 was seen.
For example, on input {20, 4, 20, 5, 8, 8}, the code should print 2.

## Switch statements
> **Exercise** Write a for loop that iterates through an array of integers, and
prints out "Found 3" each time the number 3 is found, and " Saw 5" each time
the number 5 is found. Use a switch statement to compare the numbers
