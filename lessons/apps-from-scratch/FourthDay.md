[Test Json](http://http://jsjrobotics.nyc/cgi-bin/class_12_20_2016.pl)

Your assignment is to build an Android application.
It must run on a Nexus 5 Api 25 Emulator, or any cell phone you can demonstrate 
your application working on.

- The app should work in both portrait and landscape.
- In your activity, you must have a fragment.
- In this fragment, you must have a view that scrolls content.
- The user must be able to scroll through each of the house listings returned from the url.
- For each house, you must show the style, price and location.
- The view that displays all the house information should be 150dp in height.

The url is dynamic. If you are receiving the same content each time you go to that 
website, you should verify your browser / app is not caching the result.
