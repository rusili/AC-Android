## Prework 08-30
Using the code from https://github.com/C4Q/AC3.3/blob/master/codeSamples/Hangman.java modify the main() method so that 
after each game, a user is prompted if they want to play again. 

To run, you will need to download [`SecretWord`](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-0/blob/master/in-class%20exercise%20solutions/Hangman/SecretWord.java) and [`Drawing`](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-0/blob/master/in-class%20exercise%20solutions/Hangman/Drawing.java) classes. Make sure the Hangman, SecretWord and Drawing class are all in the same package.

If you would rather not download the files, and want to clone a working project, goto https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/c2b324d6eec2e5bbcf3a6b4214bc2994. You will need to write your code in Main.java if you go this route.

## Program Requirements
* If the user enters yes or y, the game should start over.

* If the user enters no or n, the game should end. 

* If the user enters any other input, the system should request a valid input, and prompt the user again.

All user input should be case insensitive.
